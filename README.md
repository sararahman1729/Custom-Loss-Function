# Custom-Loss-Function
This project introduces a custom loss function for Knowledge Distillation 
(KD) technique to improve the training of the student model.  
In this project a custom loss function using the standard cross 
entropy loss function and confidence penalty is being created to test in some datasets like 
CIFAR-100, Tiny ImageNet, CUB-200. 

**Student Models Used:** ShuffleNetV1, ResNet-18, ResNet-34, ResNet-50, 
EfficientNet-B0. 

**Teacher Models Used:** VGG13-BN, ResNet50, DeepLabV3+ResNet101 (for 
segmentation), EfficientNet-B0/B3, ResNet-50.
